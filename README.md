# AVL Tree Implementation

This repository contains the code for implementing an AVL tree (balanced binary search tree) in Python. The implementation covers the Node and Tree classes, build_tree() method, and the insert() and delete() methods for inserting and removing nodes in the AVL tree.

## Features
- Node class with attributes for key value, parent node, left and right children, and height
- Tree class with a build_tree() method for constructing a balanced binary search tree from a list of items
- Insert() and delete() methods for adding and removing nodes while maintaining the balance of the tree

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/sminerport/avl-tree-implementation.git`
2. Navigate to the repository folder: `cd avl-tree-implementation`
3. Run the main script: `python main.py`

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
